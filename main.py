main.py

Main entry point for the Movie Recommendation System.

This script integrates all the modules in the system using a class-based structure:
1. User Interface (`ui.py`): Collects user preferences through prompts, quizzes, or genre selection.
2. Recommendation Engine (`recommender.py`): Matches user preferences with movies and selects the best fits.
3. Data Handler (`data_handler.py`): Loads and parses movie data from a CSV file, handling errors gracefully.

Execution Flow:
- A MovieRecommenderSystem class encapsulates the main workflow.
- The program begins by resolving the path to the movie data file.
- It loads and validates the dataset from a local CSV.
- Users are prompted to select how many movie recommendations they'd like.
- Then, they input their genre preferences, choose to take a quiz, or opt for a random selection.
- The system processes the input and displays relevant movie suggestions.
- The loop repeats until the user decides to exit.

This is the file that ties everything together and allows the user to interact with the system in a user-friendly loop.
